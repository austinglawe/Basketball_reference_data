##THERE were many nulls for the indicators of the player awards. I wanted to find those NULLs and join the all_players table to generate those so I can then put
them into the all_awards table and better populate the data within there.

SELECT all_players.player_id,
		all_player_awards.player,
		all_player_awards.indicator
FROM all_player_awards
JOIN all_players
ON all_Players.player = all_player_awards.player
WHERE indicator IS NULL
ORDER BY all_player_awards.player
in excel I had 1881 rows to fill but the results only showed 1876 in SQL so I needed to further investigate.


The numbers weren't adding up so I did a Left join instead of a regular join to find the 5 rows I had been missing.
SELECT all_players.player_id,
		all_player_awards.player,
		all_player_awards.indicator
FROM all_player_awards
LEFT JOIN all_players
ON all_Players.player = all_player_awards.player
WHERE indicator IS NULL AND player_id IS NULL
ORDER BY all_player_awards.player

Now I ran, 
SELECT all_players.player_id,
		all_player_awards.player,
		all_player_awards.indicator
FROM all_player_awards
LEFT JOIN all_players
ON all_Players.player = all_player_awards.player
WHERE indicator IS NULL
ORDER BY all_player_awards.player
##FROM here I was able to put those into excel and have all the indicators filled in besides the 5 I needed to look up manually.
Doing this didn't work perfect as Željko Rebrača was placed below Zydrunas Ilguaskas in SQL but I manually reordered that.
I plugged this into SQL to check it worked, using this formula:

SELECT all_players.player_id,
		all_player_awards_update.player,
		all_player_awards_update.indicator
FROM all_player_awards_update
LEFT JOIN all_players
ON all_Players.player = all_player_awards_update.player
WHERE player_id != indicator

##It came back that 98 rows were not correct, but upon further review, I realized it was returning many names that were off by the last two digits meaning, there
were other people that played in the NBA with the same name, but the SQL results only showed the first result from the all_players table it pulled from.
I then used this formula:

SELECT all_players.player_id,
		all_player_awards_update.player,
		all_player_awards_update.indicator
FROM all_player_awards_update
LEFT JOIN all_players
ON all_Players.player = all_player_awards_update.player
WHERE SUBSTR(player_id, 1, LENGTH(player_id)-2) != SUBSTR(indicator, 1, LENGTH(indicator)-2)

With this formula 39 rows were still incorrect. And I can tell, they were all pushed down one row to be messed up.
After manually going through, I checked again and missed 3, I then went back over them and then checked again and completed this successfully.


How many All-NBA teams has LeBron James made. Which teams, and how many times? And how many in total?

SELECT 	Player,
		indicator,
		Full_award AS award,
		COUNT(Full_award) number
FROM
(SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM all_player_awards_update3
WHERE Full_award LIKE "%All-NBA%")
GROUP BY Player, indicator, Full_award
HAVING Player = "LeBron James"
ORDER BY Player, award



##How many players have ever made an All-NBA team (1st, 2nd, or 3rd Team). How many have they made? Then who was been on the most?

SELECT  Player,
		indicator,
		SUM(number) AS number
FROM
(SELECT 	Player,
		indicator,
		Full_award AS award,
		COUNT(Full_award) number
FROM
(SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM all_player_awards_update3
WHERE Full_award LIKE "%All-NBA%")
GROUP BY Player, indicator, Full_award
ORDER BY Player, award)
GROUP BY player, indicator
ORDER BY number DESC

##And All-Defensive?
SELECT  Player,
		indicator,
		SUM(number) AS number
FROM
(SELECT 	Player,
		indicator,
		Full_award AS award,
		COUNT(Full_award) number
FROM
(SELECT DISTINCT *

##Finding all NBA/BAA players with any minute or stat in an NBA game

###how can i connect sql tables where all_player_awards_update3.indicator is equal to player_season_stats_without_total_tm.player_id?
I want to show And all the columns in the all_player_awards_update3 table and all the columns within the player_season_stats_without_total_tm table. 
How can I join these tables together to only show the values that are equal from all_player_awards_update3.season = player_season_stats_without_total_tm.season , 
all_player_awards_update3.player = player_season_stats_without_total_tm. , and player_season_stats_without_total_tm.player_id = all_player_awards_update3.indicator

SELECT apa.*, psswt.*
FROM all_player_awards_update3 apa
JOIN player_season_stats_without_total_tm psswt ON apa.season = psswt.season
AND apa.player = psswt.player
AND psswt.player_id = apa.indicator;
