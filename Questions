## How many times has a player played for multiple teams in a season and how many did they play for?

##THERE were many nulls for the indicators of the player awards. I wanted to find those NULLs and join the all_players table to generate those so I can then put
them into the all_awards table and better populate the data within there.

SELECT all_players.player_id,
		all_player_awards.player,
		all_player_awards.indicator
FROM all_player_awards
JOIN all_players
ON all_Players.player = all_player_awards.player
WHERE indicator IS NULL
ORDER BY all_player_awards.player
in excel I had 1881 rows to fill but the results only showed 1876 in SQL so I needed to further investigate.


The numbers weren't adding up so I did a Left join instead of a regular join to find the 5 rows I had been missing.
SELECT all_players.player_id,
		all_player_awards.player,
		all_player_awards.indicator
FROM all_player_awards
LEFT JOIN all_players
ON all_Players.player = all_player_awards.player
WHERE indicator IS NULL AND player_id IS NULL
ORDER BY all_player_awards.player

Now I ran, 
SELECT all_players.player_id,
		all_player_awards.player,
		all_player_awards.indicator
FROM all_player_awards
LEFT JOIN all_players
ON all_Players.player = all_player_awards.player
WHERE indicator IS NULL
ORDER BY all_player_awards.player
##FROM here I was able to put those into excel and have all the indicators filled in besides the 5 I needed to look up manually.
Doing this didn't work perfect as Željko Rebrača was placed below Zydrunas Ilguaskas in SQL but I manually reordered that.
